Once you’re familiar with calculus, it’s easy to take for granted the inner workings of the derivative - we just accept that the derivative of x^2 is 2x by the power rule. However, depending on how mean your calculus teacher was, you may have spent months not being taught the power rule, and instead required to compute derivatives using the definition.
